<h3 id="project-summary">Project Summary</h3>
<p>In this paper, we propose a control scheme that allows generic commercial multirotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to infer human intent from physical interaction.</p>

<p>Humans apply forces by touching it or pulling a nylon string attached to the body frame of the vehicle. The estimations of these forces, obtained via a square root unscented Kalman filter, are used by an admittance controller to generate a reference trajectory such that the vehicle reacts as a desired mass-damper system.</p>

<p>To track this trajectory, the differential flatness property of the multirotor dynamic model is exploited. This, in fact, allows the generation of any possible kind of input required by the on-board controller supplied by the manufacturer. 
We validate our results experimentally on a Parrot Bebop 2 quadrotor, a commercially available UAV.</p>
