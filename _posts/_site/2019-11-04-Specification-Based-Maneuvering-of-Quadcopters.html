<h3 id="project-summary">Project Summary</h3>
<p>In this paper, we study the problem of navigating
quadcopters through a sequence of hoops.</p>

<p>The specification
may be given directly or indirectly via a linear temporal logic
(LTL) formula. We approach this problem in three phases.</p>

<p>First, we introduce a planner that generates a path through
a given sequence of hoops.</p>

<p>Second, we augment our planner
to leverage a given specification in linear temporal logic (LTL)
and generate a sequence that satisfies this specification.</p>

<p>Third,
we implement cross-entropy optimization on this planner to
enhance trajectory performance where quadcopter trajectories
are modified within the solution space to optimize over a cost function.</p>

<p>We implement this planner as a novel interaction modality between users and quadcopters on the Robotarium. Simulation and experimental results are provided.</p>
