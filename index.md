# About Me

![Me](/assets/images/Christopher_Banks_circle.png){:width="300px" :height="300px"}



I am a robotics PhD student at the Georgia Institute of Technology. My background is in control theory, 

human robot interaction (HRI), and artificial intelligence. My research interests focus on Human Swarm Interaction

and developing tools for effective communication between humans and swarms of robots. 

I also do some work in motion planning for single/multi-agent systems.
